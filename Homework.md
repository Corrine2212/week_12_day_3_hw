1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
Breakpoint is a a marker that you place in the code to pause the execution of a program ata specific point. This lets the developer examine the programs state and variables at that particular moment.

2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
When you start debugging and encounter a breakpoint, the line of code that is on the breakpoint does not run. The execution halts before that line of code 

3. How do we debug the next line of code?
We can use the step-over or line by line debugging feature

4. What does the step into command do?
It's used to step into a function call and continue debugging within the function's code

5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
Evaluate Expression: allows you to evaluate and execute a single expression or statement in the current context of the program.
e.g. if you have a variable x in your code and you want to see it's current value during debugging you can use the Evaluate Expression feature to input  and obtain the value of x.

Evaluate Code Fragment: enables you to execute a block of code instead of single expressions or statements like the Evaluate Expression feature.
